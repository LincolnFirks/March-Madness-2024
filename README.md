This is a project I worked on for march madness bracket pools. It conissts of a web scraping system. It scrapes KenPom, then Yahoo sports user pick data. The algorithm then finds the teams with the biggest discrpancies in odds to percentage of people picking them. It compiles this data and sveral stats of my own creation into a csv file. This hsould be applicable for years to come, with adjustments made for web scraping.
