This is a project I worked on for march madness bracket pools. It scrapes KenPom, then Yahoo sports user pick data for the tournament. The algorithm then finds the teams with the biggest discrpancies in winning odds via KenPom to percentage of people picking them. It compiles this data and several stats of my own creation into a csv file. This should be applicable for years to come, with adjustments made for web scraping.
